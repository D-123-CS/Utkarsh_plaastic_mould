                        to select the material before designing the part

                        is to design the part in a CAD program, which can be
                        used to program the machines that make the mold. The

                        better understand the part, visually and

                        purchase order and final CAD file. Our terms are 50%
                        with PO, 40% on delivery and 10% on approval. The
                        down-payment covers the costs the moldmaker incurs
                        in the first half of the mold building process. The
                        40% on delivery protects the moldmaker from a long
                        part approval process by the customer. The 10% on
                        approval protects the customer's interest.

                        proposed mold design. A checklist is covered and a

                        approach to these questions should be determined at
                        the Part Design Review. The answers should be
                        documented and, if necessary, the CAD file should be
                        changed and the drawing updated. On occasion, the
                        customer requests a design change. There may be
                        additional costs incurred and the delivery date
                        might change based on the type of alteration. The
                        next 40% of payment is due upon delivery of the

                        the mold can produce a part that meets expectations.
                        We will recommend a level of testing based on how

                        expectations of the customer.
